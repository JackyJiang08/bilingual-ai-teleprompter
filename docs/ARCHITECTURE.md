# Architecture

Technical architecture of this codebase (upstream: [openTeleprompt](https://github.com/ArunNGun/openTeleprompt) v3.0.0, extended in this fork with on-device word-level speech tracking — §3.1). A Tauri v2 desktop app: Rust backend, React 19 + Vite frontend, Zustand state, Tiptap rich-text editing, plus a Swift speech-recognition sidecar. `file:line` references date from the fork-point audit; in files this fork has since modified (`lib.rs`, `ReadView.jsx`, `tokenizer.js`, settings) they may be offset — treat them as anchors, not exact coordinates.

> **Scope note.** `frontend/renderer/` is the legacy Electron v1.x renderer (plain JS, `frontend/renderer/app.js`). On macOS nothing references it anymore (this fork removed the last consumer — see §1.4); only the compiled-out Windows settings path still points at it. `docs/` (other than this file) is the GitHub Pages landing site.

## 1. High-level architecture

### 1.1 Process model

There is one Rust process and up to three WebView windows, each identified by a Tauri window label:

| Window label | Content | Created at |
|---|---|---|
| `prompter` | React app (`index.html` → `src/main.jsx` → `src/App.jsx`) — the notch island / classic pill | `setup()` at `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:693-708`, and recreated by `create_prompter_window()` at `lib.rs:511-578` on mode switch |
| `settings` | React settings panel (`settings.html` → `src/settings-main.jsx` → `src/views/SettingsView.jsx`) | lazily by `show_settings()` at `lib.rs:601-631` on tray click |
On a normal launch exactly two things appear: the notch pill (the `prompter` window in its idle state) and the tray icon. Upstream also opened a first-launch `welcome` window (borderless, centered, always-on-top) pointing at `renderer/welcome.html` — a file absent from the bundled frontend, which produced an unclosable blank/black window; this fork removed it along with the `close_welcome` command and the `~/.teleprompter-launched` marker logic. The editor is not a separate window: it is the `edit` view *inside* the prompter island, opened only by explicit action — clicking the pill, or the ⌘⇧E global shortcut (§5.2).

In addition to the windows there is one supervised child process: **`speech-sidecar`**, a Swift binary (source `src-tauri/sidecar/speech-sidecar.swift`, bundled via `externalBin` in `tauri.conf.json`) that runs Apple's `SFSpeechRecognizer` fully on-device and streams partial transcripts to the app — see §3.1.

Entry point: `src-tauri/src/main.rs:4-6` calls `open_teleprompter_lib::run()`, which registers four plugins — `tauri_plugin_global_shortcut`, `tauri_plugin_fs`, `tauri_plugin_shell`, `tauri_plugin_positioner` — installs `AppState`, registers 24 commands, and builds the tray + global shortcuts in `setup()`.

The two React windows are separate Vite entry points, declared in `vite.config.js:14-17` (`rollupOptions.input: { main: 'index.html', settings: 'settings.html' }`). They do **not** share JS state; they synchronize only through the Rust backend (see §1.3).

### 1.2 IPC layer

`tauri.conf.json:13` sets `"withGlobalTauri": true`, and the frontend has **no `@tauri-apps/api` npm dependency** (see `package.json` dependencies). All IPC goes through the injected global:

- `src/lib/api.js:1-2` — `window.__TAURI__.core.invoke` and `window.__TAURI__.event.listen`, with no-op fallbacks so the UI also runs in a plain browser (`src/App.jsx:120` uses `!window.__TAURI__` to show a dev panel).
- `src/views/SettingsView.jsx:3-16` duplicates a smaller inline `API` object for the settings window.

Direction of traffic:

- **JS → Rust (commands):** the 26 handlers registered in `run()` (`get_config`, `set_config`, `switch_mode`, `get_scripts`, `save_scripts`, `set_ignore_mouse`, `resize_prompter`, `toggle_prompter`, `resize_settings`, `quit_app`, `open_devtools`, `hide_settings`, `start_drag`, `set_movable`, `move_window`, `get_window_pos`, `open_url`, `open_settings`, `focus_prompter`, `elevate_notch_window`, `start_speech`, `stop_speech`, `get_speech_status`, `ai_complete`, `set_ai_key`, `has_ai_key`).
- **Rust → JS (events):** three event names.
  - `config-update` — broadcast by `set_config`; consumed by `App.jsx` (which normalizes snake_case→camelCase) and `SettingsView.jsx`.
  - `shortcut` — emitted to the `prompter` window with a string payload `"pause" | "faster" | "slower" | "reset"` from the global-shortcut handler, and `"stop"` from `switch_mode` and `toggle_prompter`; consumed in `ReadView.jsx`.
  - `speech-msg` — broadcast to all windows: every NDJSON line from the speech sidecar plus a synthetic `{"type":"terminated"}` on process exit (see §3.1). Consumed by `src/lib/speech.js` (tracking) and `SettingsView.jsx` (status display).

Permissions for the WebView side are scoped in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` to the `prompter` and `settings` windows (core window ops, `global-shortcut:*`, `fs:*`, `positioner:*`).

### 1.3 State ownership

Three state stores, with the Rust side as source of truth for anything persistent:

1. **Rust `AppState`**: `Mutex<Config>`, `Mutex<Option<(f64,f64)>>` (last classic-mode window position), plus the speech sidecar's `CommandChild` handle and last status value. `Config` holds `scroll_speed`, `threshold`, `screenshare_hidden`, `mode`, `opacity`, `auto_scroll`, `mic_device_id`, `theme`, `speech_lang`, `word_tracking`, and the non-secret AI settings `ai_provider`/`ai_model`/`ai_local_url`; serialized camelCase (fields added by this fork carry `#[serde(default)]`s so pre-existing config files still parse). The Anthropic API key is **not** in `Config` — it lives in the macOS Keychain (§4.4).
2. **Disk**: three dotfiles in the user's home directory (`lib.rs:123-139`): `~/.teleprompter-config.json`, `~/.teleprompter-scripts.json`, `~/.teleprompter-launched` (first-launch marker). Writes happen in `save_config` (`lib.rs:147-151`) and `save_scripts_to_disk` (`lib.rs:251-255`).
3. **Zustand store** (`src/store/index.js`): a single `useAppStore` with `view` (`'idle' | 'edit' | 'read'`), a `config` mirror, `scripts` + `currentScriptIndex`, the active script (`scriptText` plain text, `scriptDoc` Tiptap JSON), playback flags, and `recognition` — the speech-tracking state written by ReadView while reading (`engine: 'none'|'speech'|'vad'`, `status`, `message`, `cursorTokenIndex`, `matchedCount`, `total`, `confidence`).

**Caveat (verified):** the playback flags in the store (`isSpeaking`, `isPaused`, `isHoverPaused`, `isRunning`, `speedIndex`, `store/index.js:29-39`) are written by nothing — `ReadView.jsx:16-17` shadows them with local `useState`, and all `setIsSpeaking`/`setIsPaused` calls in `ReadView` are those local setters. `IdleView.jsx:4` reads the store's `isSpeaking`/`isPaused`, which therefore remain at their initial `false`. Treat the store flags as dead code inherited from a refactor; real playback state lives in `ReadView` local state + refs (§3.2.3). The newer `recognition` slice IS live — ReadView writes it while reading.

### 1.4 Known upstream quirks (relevant when extending)

Documented here because they affect where new code can safely go; none were changed in this fork:

- **(Fixed in this fork.)** Upstream pointed several release URLs at `renderer/*` paths absent from the bundled frontend (the Vite build emits only `index.html` and `settings.html`): the initial prompter (which loaded only via the asset protocol's SPA fallback — now `index.html` directly) and the first-launch `welcome` window (which rendered an unclosable blank window — now removed, see §1.1). Only the compiled-out Windows settings path still references `renderer/`.
- `src/lib/api.js:5` — `elevateNotchWindow` calls a bare `invoke` (undefined identifier; would throw if invoked). Nothing calls it: notch elevation actually happens Rust-side (§2.2). The `elevate_notch_window` command (`lib.rs:267-279`) is effectively unreachable from JS as wired.
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml:23-33`: `serde`, `serde_json`, `dirs`, `open` and all four Tauri plugins are declared under `[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]`, so the crate as committed only builds on macOS (consistent with the README's "Windows v3 coming soon").

---

## 2. Window management (notch overlay)

### 2.1 Window creation flags

Both creation sites (`lib.rs:543-558` and `lib.rs:693-708`) use `tauri::WebviewWindowBuilder` with:

```
.decorations(false)  .transparent(true)  .always_on_top(true)
.skip_taskbar(true)  .resizable(mode == "classic")  .accept_first_mouse(true)
.visible_on_all_workspaces(true)  .content_protected(false)
```

In notch mode the window is created **full screen width × 200 px at (0, 0)** (`lib.rs:528`, `lib.rs:684`); CSS renders only the island inside it. Transparency on macOS requires `"macOSPrivateApi": true` (`tauri.conf.json:19`) plus the `macos-private-api` cargo feature (`Cargo.toml:20`). The app is a menu-bar-style accessory: `set_activation_policy(ActivationPolicy::Accessory)` (`lib.rs:675`) and `LSUIElement=true` in `src-tauri/Info.plist`.

### 2.2 Elevation above the menu bar (the notch trick)

`elevate_to_notch_level()` (`lib.rs:13-52`, macOS only) drops below Tauri to raw AppKit via `objc2`/`objc2-app-kit`:

1. `window.ns_window()` obtains the `NSWindow` pointer (`lib.rs:16`).
2. `setLevel(27)` — `NSMainMenuWindowLevel` (24) + 3, so the window floats **above the menu bar** (`lib.rs:25`).
3. `setCollectionBehavior((1<<0)|(1<<4)|(1<<6)|(1<<8))` — `canJoinAllSpaces | stationary | ignoresCycle | fullScreenAuxiliary` (`lib.rs:27-29`).
4. `setHasShadow(false)` (`lib.rs:30`).
5. `setFrame_display` repositions the window flush with the physical screen top. **Display selection (this fork):** the target screen is the one with a physical notch — the first `NSScreen` whose `safeAreaInsets.top > 0` — falling back to `mainScreen` when no notch display exists (clamshell mode, external-only setups). Upstream used `mainScreen` (the screen with keyboard focus) unconditionally, which parked the pill on an external monitor whenever focus was there; requires macOS 12+ API, and `minimumSystemVersion` is now 13.0. The window is 200 px tall = ~160 px notch content + 40 px overlap kept on-screen because WKWebView stops rendering when fully above the visible area (comment at `lib.rs:7-12`).

Called from `setup()` (`lib.rs:713-715`) and from `create_prompter_window()` (`lib.rs:572-575`); `switch_mode` dispatches recreation via `run_on_main_thread` because NSWindow APIs must run on the main thread (`lib.rs:327-331`).

### 2.3 Hidden from screen capture

`apply_screenshare_mode()` (`lib.rs:260-262`) calls Tauri's `WebviewWindow::set_content_protected(bool)` — on macOS this sets `NSWindow.sharingType = .none`, which excludes the window from screen recording/sharing. It is applied at window creation (`lib.rs:567`, `lib.rs:717-719`) and re-applied whenever `set_config` receives `screenshareHidden` (`lib.rs:302-304`). Default is ON (`Config::default`, `lib.rs:96`).

### 2.4 Resizing, click-through, dragging

- **Resize protocol:** the frontend owns geometry. `App.jsx:11-23` defines per-view sizes (`ISLAND_SIZES` / `CLASSIC_SIZES`); the effect at `App.jsx:87-94` calls `API.resizePrompter` on every view/hover/mode change. Rust's `resize_prompter` (`lib.rs:355-392`) in notch mode sizes the window to exactly the island and horizontally centers it at y = 0 (so the small idle pill doesn't intercept clicks across the whole screen top); in classic mode it resizes in place.
- **Click-through:** `set_ignore_mouse` → `set_ignore_cursor_events` (`lib.rs:342-352`), force-disabled in classic mode. Never set at creation time — a code comment (`lib.rs:565-566`) notes doing so breaks WKWebView rendering; `App.jsx:45` re-enables mouse after mount.
- **Classic dragging:** mousedown on non-interactive elements calls `API.startDrag()` → `start_dragging()` (`App.jsx:102-107`, `lib.rs:480-485`); position persisted in `AppState.classic_pos` via `move_window` (`lib.rs:458-467`).
- **Closing vs quitting (this fork):** the editor's header ✕ collapses the island back to the idle pill (the prompter window itself never closes); the app quits only through explicit quit controls — a hover-revealed quit icon on the idle pill (always visible in classic mode), a ⏻ button in the editor header, or the tray settings panel's Quit — all invoking `quit_app`, whose `RunEvent::Exit` handler kills the speech sidecar so no child process outlives the app.
- **Settings window placement:** anchored to the tray icon via `tauri-plugin-positioner` `Position::TrayCenter`, gated by the `TRAY_CLICKED` atomic because the positioner panics before it has seen a tray event (`lib.rs:63`, `lib.rs:591-598`); falls back to bottom-right. Settings hides instead of closing (`CloseRequested` handler, `lib.rs:847-855`) and auto-hides on blur (`SettingsView.jsx:73-76`).

## 3. Reading-position pipelines

Two pipelines can drive the prompter while reading:

1. **Word-level speech tracking** (§3.1, default) — on-device speech recognition aligns what you say against the script; the scroll offset follows your actual reading position, spoken text dims, and the current word is highlighted.
2. **Frequency-based voice activation** (§3.2, fallback) — the original upstream energy heuristic: constant-speed scroll while a per-frame "is the user speaking?" boolean is true. Used when word tracking is disabled in settings, when running outside Tauri (browser dev), or when recognition is unavailable (see degradation rules below).

### 3.1 Word-level speech tracking (speech sidecar)

**Process.** `src-tauri/sidecar/speech-sidecar.swift` is a standalone Swift binary compiled by `scripts/build-sidecar.sh` into `src-tauri/binaries/speech-sidecar-<target-triple>` (gitignored; built automatically by `beforeDevCommand`/`beforeBuildCommand`) and bundled through `externalBin`. It runs `SFSpeechRecognizer` with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true`, `shouldReportPartialResults = true`, `taskHint = .dictation`, and `addsPunctuation = false`, fed by an `AVAudioEngine` input tap. **All recognition is on-device; nothing leaves the machine** — the binary's only output channel is NDJSON on stdout to the parent app. It refuses to run at all (fatal `ondevice_unsupported`) if the selected locale's on-device model is missing.

**Protocol** (one JSON object per stdout line): `ready {locale, onDevice}`, `partial`/`final {session, text, confidence}` (confidence = mean of `SFTranscriptionSegment` confidences), and `error {code, message, fatal}`. Recognition tasks are rotated on final results and recoverable errors — each rotation increments `session`, and each session's transcript starts empty. Fatal codes: `auth_denied`, `auth_restricted`, `locale_unavailable`, `ondevice_unsupported`, `audio_error`, `recognizer_storm` (three failures within 2 s of session start).

**Supervision (Rust).** `start_speech(locale)` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` kills any previous instance, spawns the sidecar via `tauri_plugin_shell`'s `sidecar()`, and pumps its stdout: every parsed line is broadcast to all windows as a `speech-msg` event; `ready`/`error` lines are also stored in `AppState.speech_status` so the settings window can query the latest state via `get_speech_status` after the fact. Process exit surfaces as a synthetic `{"type":"terminated","code"}` message. `stop_speech` kills the child; the `RunEvent::Exit` handler guarantees the sidecar never outlives the app. Rust makes no policy decisions — restart and fallback logic live in the frontend.

**Matching (JS).** `src/lib/matcher.js` implements the forward-searching cursor:

- Script tokens come from `tokenizeDoc` (`src/lib/tokenizer.js`), which splits whitespace-delimited chunks and then breaks CJK ideograph runs into one token per character (`cjk: true`, `splitCJK`) — Mandarin is matched character-by-character, embedded Latin runs ("我们的React项目") stay whole, and `spaceAfter` records where the source actually had whitespace so rendering doesn't invent gaps.
- Transcript text is tokenized the same way (`tokenizeTranscript`), and both sides are normalized by `normalizeWord`: NFKC fold (full-width → half-width), lowercase, strip all non-letter/non-digit characters in any script.
- `createCursorMatcher(tokens)` keeps a **monotonic** cursor over the matchable word tokens. Each new transcript word is searched in a lookahead window (default 12 words) starting at the cursor; a hit advances the cursor past it (absorbing skipped script words), a miss is dropped (fillers like "um"/"嗯", misreads). Partials that revise already-consumed words are ignored via longest-common-prefix diffing, and session rotation resets transcript state without moving the cursor. The window bound also prevents a stray common word ("the", "的") from teleporting the cursor. Unit tests: `src/lib/__tests__/matcher.test.js` and `tokenizer.test.js` (`npm test`).

**Frontend wiring.** `src/lib/speech.js` (`createSpeechTracker`) subscribes to `speech-msg`, feeds partials into the matcher, and owns policy: up to 2 restarts on unexpected termination, then fallback; fatal error codes map to user-facing messages (`fallbackMessageFor`). `ReadView.jsx` starts the tracker on mount when `config.wordTracking` is on, mirrors every update into the Zustand `recognition` state, and renders word tokens with per-token refs and classes — `tok-spoken` (opacity 0.35) for tokens behind the cursor, `tok-current` (accent underline) for the next expected word, full brightness ahead (`src/style.css`). The RAF loop's tracking branch eases the scroll offset toward `currentWordEl.offsetTop − 0.35 × viewportHeight` with exponential smoothing (`FOLLOW_SMOOTHING`), so the reading line sits at ~35% of the viewport and the scroll speed is entirely driven by the reader. Cue markers, hover-pause, manual wheel scrubbing, and the `[PAUSE]`/`[BREATHE]`/`[SLOW]` behaviors are unchanged.

**Degradation.** Any fatal sidecar error or restart exhaustion calls the tracker's `onFallback`: ReadView clears tracking state, starts the legacy VAD engine (§3.2), and the settings window shows the reason (its status line listens to `speech-msg` and initializes from `get_speech_status`). Word tracking can also be disabled outright with the settings toggle. Permissions: `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (upstream) plus `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` (this fork) in `src-tauri/Info.plist`; the sidecar child process inherits the app's TCC attribution.

### 3.2 Frequency-based voice activation (fallback)

The original upstream pipeline. It performs no speech recognition — an energy heuristic answers one boolean per frame: *is the user speaking?* Scrolling is constant-speed while that boolean is true.

#### 3.2.1 Capture

Audio is captured **in the prompter WebView**, not in Rust, via `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` (`src/lib/mic.js:52`) with `echoCancellation`, `noiseSuppression`, `autoGainControl`, `suppressLocalAudioPlayback` (`mic.js:41-46`) and an optional exact `deviceId` from `config.micDeviceId` (with `OverconstrainedError` fallback, `mic.js:53-58`). OS permission is granted through `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` (`src-tauri/Info.plist`) and the `com.apple.security.(device.)audio-input` entitlements (`src-tauri/entitlements.plist`); `App.jsx:66-69` pre-probes permission on mount. The settings window opens its own independent stream for the level meter (`SettingsView.jsx:118-139`).

#### 3.2.2 Detection — `createMicEngine` (`src/lib/mic.js:8-110`)

Factory returning `{ start(micDeviceId), stop(), setThreshold(v) }`. Inside `start()`:

- Web Audio graph: `MediaStreamSource → AnalyserNode`, `fftSize = 2048`, `smoothingTimeConstant = 0.3` (`mic.js:64-69`).
- A 16 ms `setInterval` loop (`mic.js:75-93`) computes RMS over the time-domain buffer; gate #1 is `rms > VOLUME_THRESHOLD` (default `0.018`, user-tunable — see §5).
- Gate #2 is `isVoiceFrequency()` (`mic.js:17-38`), the **85–3400 Hz analysis**: from `getFloatFrequencyData` (dB values), it converts bins to linear energy (`10^(dB/20)`) and averages two bands — the voice band `85–3400 Hz` and a high band `4000–8000 Hz` (bin indices derived from `binHz = sampleRate / fftSize`, `mic.js:73`). Speech passes if `voiceAvg / highAvg > 2.5` (keyboard clicks and broadband noise have proportionally more high-band energy).
- **Hysteresis:** a frame counter increments +1 on pass, decrements −2 on fail, clamped to `[0, 8]`; speech is asserted only at `VOICE_FRAMES_REQUIRED = 8` consecutive-ish frames (`mic.js:6`, `mic.js:34-37`), i.e. ~130 ms of sustained voice.
- **Debounce down:** on the first non-speech frame while speaking, a 400 ms timer (`SILENCE_DELAY_MS`, `mic.js:5`) fires `onSilence`; any speech frame cancels it. `onSpeaking` fires on the rising edge.

#### 3.2.3 Where scroll state lives

The VAD engine is started by `ReadView`'s `startVadEngine()` (on mount when word tracking is off/unavailable, or later via fallback); its callbacks set **local** state/refs: `isSpeakingRef` + `useState isSpeaking` + `micStatus`. A mic-device change tears down and recreates the engine; threshold changes are pushed live via `setThreshold`.

Both pipelines share one `requestAnimationFrame` loop in `ReadView` with two branches. The legacy branch:

```
shouldScroll = config.autoScroll ? true : isSpeakingRef.current   // (outer guard: not paused)
scrollPosRef.current += SCROLL_SPEED_BASE(0.1) * SPEEDS[speedIdx] * frameDelta
scriptTextRef.current.style.transform = translateY(-scrollPos)
```

with `paused = isPausedRef || isHoverPausedRef` gating both branches. Scroll position is a ref (`scrollPosRef`), applied as a CSS transform — it never touches React state or the Zustand store (the `recognition` slice is updated from speech-tracking callbacks, not from the RAF loop). As noted in §1.3, the older Zustand playback flags are dead; Zustand's real responsibilities in read mode are `scriptText`/`scriptDoc` (input), `recognition` (output for other views), and `setView` (exit). Cue markers (`[PAUSE]`, `[BREATHE]`, `[SLOW]`) fire when their DOM element enters the top 40 % of the viewport (`checkMarkers`), driving timed pauses or a speed step-down. Manual wheel scrubbing writes the same `scrollPosRef`.

---

## 4. Script editor and library

### 4.1 Data model

One `Script` = `{ name, text, content }` (`lib.rs:107-113`): `name` is display title, `text` is the plain-text flattening, `content` is the **Tiptap JSON document serialized as a string**. The frontend mirrors this shape untyped. Three seeded demo scripts are generated in `default_scripts()` (`lib.rs:153-243`) when no scripts file exists.

### 4.2 Persistence

Whole-array read/write through two commands: `get_scripts` → `load_scripts()` and `save_scripts` → `save_scripts_to_disk()` (`lib.rs:335-339`, `245-255`), storing pretty-printed JSON at `~/.teleprompter-scripts.json`. There is no partial update, no IDs (scripts are addressed by array index — see `currentScriptIndex`, `store/index.js:20`), and no debounce; every save rewrites the file.

### 4.3 Tiptap integration (`src/views/EditView.jsx`)

- Editor: `useEditor` with `StarterKit`, `TextStyle`, `Color` extensions (`EditView.jsx:36-45`); toolbar offers bold, five fixed colors, and cue-marker insertion (`MARKERS = ['[PAUSE]','[SLOW]','[BREATHE]']`, `EditView.jsx:16`; markers are inserted as plain text tokens, `insertMarker`, `EditView.jsx:121-123`).
- Save: `saveCurrentScript` (`EditView.jsx:60-75`) derives `name` from the first line (≤ 40 chars), `text` from `editor.getText()`, `content` from `JSON.stringify(editor.getJSON())`, updates the array in Zustand, and calls `API.saveScripts` (write-through).
- Load: `loadScript(i)` / mount effect parse `script.content` back into the editor, falling back to wrapping `script.text` in a paragraph on parse failure (`EditView.jsx:48-58`, `99-111`).
- Handoff to the prompter: `handleStart` (`EditView.jsx:77-85`) saves, then `setScriptText(text)` + `setScriptDoc(editor.getJSON())` + `setView('read')`.
- Rendering for reading: `tokenizeDoc` (`src/lib/tokenizer.js`) walks the Tiptap JSON and flattens it to tokens `{ type: 'word'|'marker'|'newline', text, bold, color, marker, cjk, spaceAfter }`. Chunks are split on whitespace, then CJK ideograph runs are split per character (see §3.1); `spaceAfter` preserves original spacing for display. `ReadView` renders one `<span>` per token (with speech-tracking classes, §3.1). Word-count stats still assume `\s+`-separated words at 130 WPM (`EditView.jsx:18-24`), so the estimate is rough for Chinese scripts.

---

### 4.4 Prepare with AI (this fork)

An optional, explicitly user-triggered preprocessing step that rewrites a raw script into teleprompter form (short lines, spoken phrasing, cue markers; Chinese lines broken at prosodic boundaries). Fully inert when unconfigured — the app behaves exactly as upstream.

**Split of responsibilities.** Everything testable lives in JS; secrets and transport live in Rust:

- `src/lib/ai.js` — builds the prompt (`buildPrepareMessages`, with a CJK-detection addendum for Chinese scripts), parses/normalizes the response (`parsePreparedResponse`: fence stripping, marker-case normalization, blank-line collapsing), converts prepared text to a Tiptap doc (`preparedTextToDoc`, one paragraph per line), and maps provider error codes to actionable messages (`mapAiError`). Unit tests with mocked providers: `src/lib/__tests__/ai.test.js`.
- `ai_complete(system, prompt)` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — a dumb async transport with two implementations behind `config.ai_provider`:
  - `"anthropic"` — `POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` via `reqwest`; model from `ai_model` (default `claude-opus-5`); handles the `refusal` stop reason and opts into server-side refusal fallbacks (`fallbacks: "default"`, beta `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01`).
  - `"local"` — `POST {ai_local_url}/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible, e.g. Ollama) for fully offline use; requires an explicit model name.
  - Errors return as `code:detail` strings (`no_provider`, `no_api_key`, `no_model`, `auth`, `rate_limit` with retry-after, `model_not_found`, `network`, `refusal`, `server`, `parse`).

**Key storage.** The Anthropic API key is stored in the macOS Keychain via the `keyring` crate (service `OpenTeleprompter`, account `anthropic-api-key`). `set_ai_key` writes/deletes, `has_ai_key` reports existence; the key itself is read only inside `ai_complete` at request time and **never crosses IPC to the WebView** and never touches the JSON config files.

**UI flow.** `EditView.jsx` `handlePrepare`: no provider configured → `open_settings` (settings carries setup instructions); otherwise `prepareScript(editor.getText())`. On success the view switches to a side-by-side review — original (read-only) vs prepared (editable textarea) — with Accept/Reject. `acceptReview` first appends the pre-preparation script to the library (`"<name> · original"`, persisted via `save_scripts`) so the original stays recoverable, then replaces the editor content with `preparedTextToDoc(...)`. Reject leaves the editor untouched. Nothing ever runs automatically.

---

## 5. Settings system and global shortcuts

### 5.1 Config flow

`SettingsView` (own window, §1.1) reads config on mount and writes individual patches through `set_config` (`lib.rs:287-306`), which merges the patch into `AppState`, persists to disk, re-applies content protection, and broadcasts `config-update` — closing the loop to the prompter window (`App.jsx:52-64`) and back to any other settings instance. Notable mappings:

- The UI "Voice Input" toggle is the **inverse** of `autoScroll` (`SettingsView.jsx:88`, `164-167`): voice input ON ⇒ `autoScroll: false` (scroll only while speaking); OFF ⇒ `autoScroll: true` (scroll continuously).
- Voice sensitivity: a log-scale slider mapping `0.003–0.562` RMS (`sliderToThreshold`, `SettingsView.jsx:19-22`), displayed in dB, with a live RMS meter from its own mic stream (`startMeter`, `SettingsView.jsx:118-139`).
- Mode switching calls the dedicated `switch_mode` command (not `set_config`) because the prompter window must be destroyed and recreated (`SettingsView.jsx:154-157`, `lib.rs:309-333`).
- Mic enumeration via `enumerateDevices` after a temporary permission-priming stream (`SettingsView.jsx:105-116`).
- Word tracking (this fork): a "Word Tracking" toggle (`wordTracking`) and an English/中文 selector (`speechLang: 'en-US' | 'zh-CN'`), plus a live status line driven by `get_speech_status` + `speech-msg` events and an on-device privacy note. A language change takes effect at the start of the next reading session (the sidecar takes its locale at spawn).
- Prepare with AI (this fork): provider selector (Off / Claude API / Local → `aiProvider`), model and local-URL text fields (`aiModel`, `aiLocalUrl`, committed on blur), and Keychain key management through `set_ai_key`/`has_ai_key` (the key value never reaches the settings window after save). Includes the explicit-action notice required by the feature: scripts are sent only on ✦ Prepare.

### 5.2 Global shortcuts

Registered in `setup()` using `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` (`lib.rs:809-843`). On macOS both `⌘⇧` (SUPER) and `⌃⇧` (CONTROL) variants are registered for `Space`, `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `KeyR`, and (this fork) `KeyE` — the `"edit"` action, which shows the prompter window and is handled app-level in `App.jsx` to open the editor from the idle pill; Windows builds register only `Ctrl+Shift` variants. Registration failures are silently skipped (`let _ =`, `lib.rs:832`) so OS-taken combos don't crash startup. The handler maps key → action string and `emit_to("prompter", "shortcut", action)` (`lib.rs:834-841`); `ReadView.jsx:152-161` translates actions into the same local state used by the on-screen controls (`pause`→`togglePause`, `faster`/`slower`→speed index, `reset`→scroll to top, `stop`→`handleDone`). Shortcuts therefore only have an effect while `ReadView` is mounted, except `stop`, which is also emitted by the backend before hiding/recreating the window.

## 7. Extension points

### 7a. Speech-recognition-driven word tracker — **implemented**

This fork implemented the word tracker along the three seams identified here; the full pipeline is documented in §3.1. Where the pieces landed:

1. **Engine seam** → `src/lib/speech.js` (`createSpeechTracker`), a sibling of `createMicEngine` that streams sidecar transcripts into the matcher and owns restart/fallback policy. The RMS/band VAD (`src/lib/mic.js`) was kept intact as the fallback engine.
2. **Scroll-application seam** → the RAF loop in `ReadView.jsx` gained a tracking branch: per-word refs (`wordRefs`) give token→DOM geometry, and the scroll offset eases toward the current word's `offsetTop` at the 35% reading line.
3. **Token seam** → `tokenizeDoc` splits CJK runs per character (with `cjk`/`spaceAfter` flags) instead of `Intl.Segmenter` word segmentation — per-character matching proved simpler and more robust for cursor tracking; `src/lib/matcher.js` handles normalization and transcript alignment. Still open: the 130-WPM stat in `EditView.jsx:18-24` remains whitespace-based.

Remaining extension surface here: swapping the recognizer (e.g. a Whisper sidecar for more locales) only requires emitting the same NDJSON protocol from a different binary; nothing above the sidecar changes.

### 7b. Script preprocessing before a script is loaded into the prompter — **implemented**

This fork implemented AI script preparation at the editor level ("Prepare with AI", §4.4): the transform runs on the editor's current text on explicit user action, with a review step, rather than silently inside `handleStart`. The analysis below remains valid for further preprocessing hooks (e.g. automatic per-`Go` transforms or token-level annotation).

There is a single choke point where an edited script becomes the active prompter content: **`handleStart` in `src/views/EditView.jsx:77-85`**. It computes `text` and `editor.getJSON()`, then calls `setScriptText` / `setScriptDoc` (`store/index.js:24-27`) and `setView('read')`. An AI preprocessing step (cleanup, sentence segmentation, automatic `[PAUSE]`/`[BREATHE]` insertion, pinyin/translation annotation) slots in as an async transform of the Tiptap JSON between `editor.getJSON()` and `setScriptDoc`, ideally with a loading state on the "Go →" button. Because `ReadView` consumes only `scriptDoc`/`scriptText` from the store (`ReadView.jsx:8-9`), no other component needs to change.

Secondary hook options, depending on where the transform should live:

- **Token level (display-only transforms):** wrap `tokenizeDoc(scriptDoc)` at `ReadView.jsx:9` — appropriate for segmentation/annotation that shouldn't alter the saved document.
- **Persistence level (transform once, store the result):** the save path `saveCurrentScript` (`EditView.jsx:60-75`) → `API.saveScripts` → `save_scripts` command (`lib.rs:339`); preprocess before `JSON.stringify(editor.getJSON())` so the library stores the processed doc. Editor load paths that would then receive processed content: the mount effect (`EditView.jsx:48-58`) and `loadScript` (`EditView.jsx:99-111`).
- **Backend level (if preprocessing calls an LLM or heavy native code):** add a new `#[tauri::command] async fn preprocess_script(doc: String) -> Result<String, String>` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, register it in the `invoke_handler` list (`lib.rs:660-670`), expose it in `src/lib/api.js`, and await it inside `handleStart`. The `Script.content`-as-JSON-string convention (`lib.rs:112`) means the command can operate on the serialized doc directly.

The cue-marker system is the natural output format for AI-inserted delivery hints: markers are plain-text tokens recognized by `MARKER_RE` (`tokenizer.js:4`) and acted on in `checkMarkers` (`ReadView.jsx:87-113`), so a preprocessor only needs to inject ` [PAUSE] ` text nodes — no renderer changes. Adding new marker types requires touching only `MARKER_RE`, the `checkMarkers` dispatch, and (optionally) the editor toolbar list (`EditView.jsx:16`).
