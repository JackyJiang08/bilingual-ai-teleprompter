# Changelog

## v1.1.0 — 2026-08-20

UI and word-tracking polish release, driven by real-world use on a
MacBook Pro 14" (M4).

### Word tracking

- **Script-biased recognition (macOS 14+):** each reading session builds a
  customized on-device language model from the current script
  (`SFCustomLanguageModelData`, one phrase per line), cached per
  (script, locale) hash and rebuilt on edit; the recognition session rotates
  to the biased model once prepared, and unsupported systems/locales fall
  back to the stock model silently. Measured on a jargon-heavy sentence:
  words recognized 10/18 → 13/18, p90 word-to-recognition latency
  1428 ms → 792 ms (methodology in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.3)
- Display-side responsiveness: scroll-easing time constant ~280 ms → ~100 ms,
  spoken-word fade 300 ms → 150 ms — the next-expected-word highlight now
  reads slightly ahead of the voice instead of trailing it
- Latency instrumentation: sidecar messages carry timestamps, a deterministic
  measurement harness (`scripts/track-latency.mjs` + sidecar `--audio-file`
  mode) records partial cadence and spoken-word→partial latency; baseline on
  an M4: partials every ~250 ms, word→partial p50 400 ms / p90 619 ms
- Fixed: adopting the custom model mid-session could cascade a canceled
  recognition task's error into a fatal `recognizer_storm`
- Script/recognition language mismatches (English script with 中文 tracking,
  or a mostly-Chinese script with English) are detected when reading starts
  and surfaced in the reading view and the settings window
- Dev-only tracking-quality overlay (`?trackdebug=1`): raw partials vs
  matched position, LM state, confidence, partial age

### UI

- **Notch fit:** the collapsed pill now derives its exact width, height, and
  x-position from the physical notch at runtime (NSScreen `safeAreaInsets` +
  auxiliary top areas) instead of hardcoded values, correct on any model and
  any display-scaling option; the expanded panel centers on the measured
  notch. Non-notch displays and classic mode are unchanged
- **Editor simplified around reading on camera:** single header row —
  close · script switcher tabs (with a "+" tab replacing + New) ·
  ✦ Prepare · Go · quit. Save button removed in favor of debounced autosave
  with a subtle "Saved" indicator; ⌘S remains as a manual trigger. Cue
  markers consolidated into one "+ Cue" insert menu and bold/color controls
  into a "⋯" overflow menu, both in the footer; the freed rows go to script
  text
- **Guided AI setup:** the first ✦ Prepare click opens a one-time inline
  setup explaining the two providers (Claude API key vs local Ollama), with
  a real "Test connection" validation (new `ai_test` command), then
  automatically continues the originally requested Prepare; with a provider
  configured, Prepare runs immediately behind a visible progress overlay
- **Theme-safe text colors:** script text defaults to the theme text color
  in both the editor and the prompter; explicit white/black/transparent
  color marks are neutralized at load and render time (healing legacy
  scripts), and AI-prepared output inherits the default style — no
  combination can render text invisible
- **Scrollbars:** every scrollable view uses thin overlay-style scrollbars —
  transparent track, subtle theme-tinted thumb — in both themes

### Internals

- 76 unit tests (was 58); visual golden coverage extended to 16 states
  (AI setup panel) and stabilized (fonts-ready wait, deterministic
  trackdemo scroll)
- Dev/test hooks: `TELEPROMPTER_FAKE_NOTCH`, `?aisetup=1`, `?scrolldemo=1`,
  `?trackdebug=1`, sidecar `--script` / `--audio-file`

## v1.0.0 — 2026-08-19

First release of **Bilingual AI Teleprompter**, a fork of
[openTeleprompt](https://github.com/ArunNGun/openTeleprompt) by
[ArunNGun](https://github.com/ArunNGun) (MIT). Version numbering restarts at
1.0.0 for the fork; the upstream base is openTeleprompt v3.0.0.

### Inherited from openTeleprompt v3.0.0

- Dynamic Island notch overlay with real concave corners and Apple spring
  physics; classic draggable-pill mode for Macs without a notch
- Voice-activated scrolling via frequency analysis (85–3400 Hz) — retained
  in this fork as the fallback engine
- React + Vite + Zustand frontend; Tauri v2 / Rust backend
- Rich text script editor (Tiptap): bold, color highlights, and
  `[PAUSE]` / `[SLOW]` / `[BREATHE]` cue markers
- Script library with auto-save (local only — no cloud, no accounts)
- Invisible during screen share (Zoom, Meet, Loom)
- Light & dark themes, opacity control, live speed/font-size controls,
  global shortcuts (⌘⇧Space, ⌘⇧↑↓, ⌘⇧R)

### New in this fork

**Word-level speech tracking (English + Mandarin)**

- On-device speech recognition (Apple Speech framework, via a supervised
  Swift sidecar) replaces volume-only activation: the prompter recognizes
  what you say, dims spoken text, highlights the current word, and drives
  the scroll from your actual reading position
- English (`en-US`) and Mandarin (`zh-CN`), selectable in settings; Chinese
  is matched per character, and mixed Chinese-English scripts are handled
- Forward-only cursor matching tolerates skipped words, fillers, and
  misreads; never jumps backward
- Fully private: `requiresOnDeviceRecognition` is enforced — no audio or
  transcripts leave the machine
- Graceful degradation to the original frequency-based activation when
  Speech permission is denied or the language model is unavailable, with a
  clear status message in settings

**Prepare with AI (optional)**

- "✦ Prepare" rewrites a raw script (English or Chinese) into teleprompter
  form: short lines for the narrow panel, natural spoken phrasing, and cue
  markers at rhetorically appropriate points; Chinese lines break at
  prosodic boundaries
- Side-by-side review (original vs editable prepared text) with
  Accept/Reject; the original is saved to the library before any replace
- Two providers: Anthropic API (key stored in the macOS Keychain, never in
  plaintext config) or any local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g. Ollama)
  for offline use
- Strictly opt-in: off by default, and scripts are sent only on explicit
  user action

**Fixes and maintenance**

- Visual snapshot suite repaired: the harness navigated to URL states the
  app never read, so non-idle states were untestable; browser-only test
  hooks added and coverage extended from 6 to 10 states (AI review panel,
  word-tracking read view). `puppeteer-core` declared as the dev dependency
  the harness always required
- CJK-aware tokenizer: Chinese script text is tokenized per character with
  original spacing preserved (upstream treated an unsegmented Chinese
  paragraph as one giant word)
- 50 unit tests (vitest) covering the tokenizer, cursor matcher, and AI
  prompt/parsing logic, including mixed-language cases
- Release workflow rebuilt for this repository; sidecar cross-compilation
  wired for CI (Intel builds on Apple Silicon runners)
