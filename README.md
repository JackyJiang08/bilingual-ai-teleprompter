# Bilingual AI Teleprompter

A free, open source voice-activated teleprompter for **macOS** (Windows v3 coming soon).

**Speak → it scrolls. Stop → it pauses. No subscriptions. No cloud. No accounts.**

This project is based on [openTeleprompt](https://github.com/ArunNGun/openTeleprompt) by [ArunNGun](https://github.com/ArunNGun), released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/ArunNGun/openTeleprompt#license). All credit for the original teleprompter — the voice-activated scrolling engine, Dynamic Island / Classic overlay modes, rich text editor, script library, and the rest of the upstream feature set — belongs to the upstream author. The full upstream commit history is preserved in this repository.

This fork extends the original project with:

- **Chinese / bilingual speech tracking** — voice-activated scrolling that follows Mandarin and mixed Chinese–English delivery, not just English speech (planned; in development)
- **AI script preprocessing** — automatic script cleanup, segmentation, and cue-marker insertion before a session (planned; in development)

## What's New in v3.0

### Dynamic Island — properly done
The notch overlay now has real concave corners that bite into the menubar bezel exactly like Apple's Dynamic Island. Apple spring physics (`cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`) for all expand/collapse animations. Looks like part of the OS.

### Full React frontend
Entire UI rebuilt in React + Vite with Zustand state management. Faster, cleaner, easier to extend.

### Rich text editor
Bold, color highlights, and smart cue markers: `[PAUSE]` `[SLOW]` `[BREATHE]`. Format your script exactly how you want to deliver it.

### Script library
Save multiple scripts, switch instantly. Auto-saves on start. Local only — no cloud, no account.

### Light & dark theme
Pastel light mode default. Toggle from settings or the menubar. Persists across sessions.

### Live controls while reading
Adjust scroll speed and font size on the fly — no need to pause your delivery.

### Redesigned settings panel
Clean React settings view with auto-height. All preferences in one place, persisted across sessions.

## First Launch

### macOS
Right-click the app → **Open** → click **Open** in the security dialog.

If you see "App is damaged":
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/OpenTeleprompter.app
```
This strips the macOS quarantine flag. One-time, you won't need it again.

### Windows (v2.2.1)
Run the `.exe` installer. If Windows SmartScreen blocks it, click **More info → Run anyway**.
